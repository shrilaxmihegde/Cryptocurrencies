# Purpose :

In this module, what unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. Itâ€™s time to put all these skills to use by creating an analysis for clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.

1. Describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, including real-world examples of each.

2. Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.

3. Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.

4. Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.

5. Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.
